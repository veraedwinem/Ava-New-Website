Youth ministry is more than just fun activities and games. It's about investing in the next generation of believers and helping young people navigate the challenges of growing up in today's world.

## Why Youth Ministry Matters

### Identity Formation
Teenagers are asking crucial questions:
- Who am I?
- What is my purpose?
- How do I fit in?

Our youth ministry provides a safe space to explore these questions through a biblical lens.
