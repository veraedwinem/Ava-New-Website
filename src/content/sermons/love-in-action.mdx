## Sermon Overview

Jesus demonstrated the ultimate act of love through service when He washed His disciples' feet. This powerful example teaches us that true greatness comes through serving others with humility and love.

### The Example of Jesus

1. **Humility in Leadership**
   - Jesus, the Son of God, took the role of a servant
   - True leadership serves others first
   - Putting others' needs before our own

2. **Practical Love**
   - Love is more than feelings - it's action
   - Meeting people's real needs
   - Serving without expecting recognition

3. **Following His Example**
   - "As I have done for you, you should also do"
   - Making service a lifestyle, not just an event
   - Finding joy in serving others

### Ways to Serve

- **In Our Church**: Volunteering in ministries, helping with events
- **In Our Community**: Food banks, community cleanup, visiting elderly
- **In Our Families**: Acts of kindness and service at home
- **In Our Workplaces**: Being helpful and considerate colleagues

### Challenge for the Week
